# WinHacks 2025 Terms and Conditions for Prizes

### Currency
Unless otherwise stated, all prizes are in **CAD (Canadian Dollars)**

### Default Manner of Distribution
Unless otherwise stated, all prizes are to be paid out as an **Amazon.ca gift card**.

#### Alternative Manners of Distribution
Should a winner be unable to accept a prize in the form of an Amazon.ca gift card, the WinHacks team *may* allow an exception to be made and an alternative prize distribution method may be considered. However, we cannot guarantee that we can honour every request for an alternative prize.  

**Please note that non-Canadians can still use Amazon.ca gift cards to purchase and ship items from outside of Canada!**  

**NOTE**: Only legitimate requests for an alternative method of distribution (where one truly cannot receive the prize) will be considered. Winners who request an alternative manner of distribution may expect much longer wait times to receive their prize, and may receive less than the originally-allotted prize amount due to any costs incurred. Requests are handled on a case-by-case basis. WinHacks is not responsible if winners are unable to accept their prize in the default manner of distribution.
